I made a branch off the master branch, called "readme-edits". 
1. In here I'm doing changes
2. Commiting them (just to this branch)/ pulling annything necessary/different if my partner/s have done,
3. then I will discuss it with my partner *Hello Bobby :>* and at the end I will commit the changes of this branch to the Master Branch
